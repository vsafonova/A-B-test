# A/B test 

## Brief
Implement tracking and A/B testing solutions on websites using tools such as Google Tag Manager, and applying privacy and GDPR best practices.

## Criteria
  - Create an A/B test that doesn’t redirect the user to another page/url.
  - Track user interactions.
  - At least 1 static section
  - At least one dynamic section (your A/B test)
  - At least one CTA with tracking
    - This doesn’t have to be posted anywhere, it can be a console.log to the
console with the proper naming convention and payload.
    - Keep GDPR in mind.
